    "To explain this to a friend, I would list the background and COVID Test reliability probabilities. Given those probabilities, a realistic view of the test is dependent given how many have/don't have COVID and the accuracy of the test themselves. Like in easier and more relatable probability calculations we did in grade school (ex: likeliness of drawing a specific card from a deck followed by a second specific card from a deck) I would compare Bayes theorem to that practice. The given percentages of background and COVID test reliability influence the true outcome of something happening. In this case, given that the majority of the population is negative, the test will naturally be more reliable as we are looking for test accuracy given that most people are likely negative. Since the accuracy of the test is relatively consistent, I would futher mention that the changes of population COVID contraction will influence the accuracy of the test given by the sheer chance of COVID exposure and subsequent likeliness of contracting it themselves.\n",
